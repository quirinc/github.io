# Kvothe
Kvothe has pale skin and green eyes, though the intensity of this color is often noted as changing throughout the series. His eyes are similar to the description of his mother's eyes. He has extremely red hair often compared to a flame.

He is exceptionally intelligent, quick-witted, sharp-tongued and clever, as well as a talented musician. He is also very curious, a quality that often gets him into trouble. He has a nasty temper, is reckless and often thoughtless.

In the books, some evidence (mostly cover illustrations) suggest that he is left-handed.
